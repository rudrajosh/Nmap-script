# Custom Nmap Script

## Overview

This project involves the development of a custom Nmap script designed to address specific scanning or detection problems that are not covered by the existing Nmap scripts. The custom script enhances Nmap's scanning capabilities, improves the detection of specific vulnerabilities, and automates tasks that are crucial for network security assessments.

The script was written using Lua and integrates with Nmap's Scripting Engine (NSE). It is tailored to scan and detect vulnerabilities that might be missed by the default set of Nmap scripts, making it a valuable tool for penetration testers, security analysts, and network administrators.

## Objectives

- **Extend Nmap’s functionality:** Add new scanning features to Nmap that are not covered by the default scripts.
- **Vulnerability detection:** Help identify vulnerabilities that could be overlooked by existing Nmap scripts.
- **Automate tasks:** Automate and simplify specific tasks during penetration testing or security audits, improving efficiency and accuracy.

## Features

- **Targeted Vulnerability Scanning:** Detect vulnerabilities in network services that are not covered by standard Nmap scripts.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Modify the script’s scanning parameters to cater to unique network environments.
- **Detailed Output:** Provides clear, actionable output that assists in identifying and addressing potential security issues.
- **Compatibility:** Designed to work seamlessly with Nmap, ensuring a smooth integration with existing workflows.

## Requirements

To use this custom Nmap script, you need the following:

- **Nmap**: This script relies on Nmap’s Scripting Engine (NSE) for execution. Ensure you have a working version of Nmap installed on your machine.
  - [Install Nmap](https://nmap.org/book/install.html)
- **Lua**: The script is written in Lua, so Lua needs to be installed for the Nmap scripting engine to function correctly.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository** (or Download the Script):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/custom-nmap-script.git
    ```

2. **Place the Script in the Nmap Scripts Directory:**
    - Find your Nmap scripts directory. You can check this by running `nmap --scripts` and noting the directory location.
    - Move the custom script into the appropriate directory. For example:
    ```bash
    mv custom-nmap-script.lua /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
    ```

3. **Update Nmap Script Database:**
    After adding the script, update the Nmap script database to make it available for use.
    ```bash
    nmap --script-updatedb
    ```

## Usage

To use the custom Nmap script, simply run Nmap with the `--script` flag and specify the name of your custom script. For example:

```bash
nmap --script custom-nmap-script <target>
